# Meta-regression of 28 studies including 4402 emmetropic eyes
Code (MetaRegressionCode.R) used to generate emmetrope-specific AL growth curves (from 6 to 24 years old) for East-asian (EA) and non-EA populations (and combined) as seen in the manuscript entitled "Normal Eye Growth Rates from 6 to 24 Years Old: A Meta-Regression Involving 4402 Emmetropic Eyes". All
results presented in the manuscript can be reproduced by running the code.

PS: cleaned dataset utilised herein is available as supplementary material in the aforementioned manuscript.
